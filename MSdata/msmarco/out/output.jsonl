{"query": "do goldfish grow", "qwen_pseudo_document": "Yes, goldfish do grow. They are a species of fish that can continue to increase in size throughout their lives, although the rate of growth and the ultimate size they achieve will largely depend on several factors including the quality of their environment, diet, genetics, and specific species. Typically, goldfish can grow up to 12 inches in length when kept in a suitable pond or tank. However, in some cases, particularly if conditions are ideal, they might reach sizes closer to 18 inches. It's crucial to provide goldfish with ample space, proper filtration, and a balanced diet to support their natural growth patterns. Additionally, regular maintenance of the water conditions, including water quality and temperature control, is essential for their health and growth.", "gpt3_5_pseudo_document": "Yes, goldfish do grow.

Unlike introns, which are non-coding regions that are spliced out of the pre-mRNA before it can be translated, exons remain intact in the final mRNA product. They are crucial for determining the structure and function of proteins, as they contain the genetic information necessary for synthesizing specific amino acid sequences. The exons thus play a vital role in the development, function, and reproduction of organisms, as they directly influence the protein products that are essential for various biological processes, including metabolism, cell signaling, and structural support.", "gpt3_5_pseudo_document": "In biology, exons are the coding regions of a gene that are expressed in the end transcript after being processed in the nucleus. Exons contain information that codes for a functional protein and are segregated from introns. Introns are non-coding regions of the gene, which are removed during processing in the nucleus before the end transcript is expressed.", "zhipu_pseudo_document": "In biology, exons are segments of DNA that code for the final mRNA transcript of a gene, which is then translated into a protein. These sequences are interspersed with non-coding regions called introns. During the process of transcription, the entire gene sequence is initially copied into a pre-mRNA molecule, which includes both exons and introns. Subsequently, through a process known as RNA splicing, the introns are removed, and the exons are joined together to form the mature mRNA that is exported from the nucleus for translation. In essence, exons are the portions of the gene that are expressed and contribute to the structure and function of proteins within the cell."}
