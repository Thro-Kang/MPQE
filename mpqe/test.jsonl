The faster the particles of an object move, the more kinetic energy that object has, and thus, the hotter it is. All matter is made up of atoms and molecules. Atoms and molecules are constantly moving, which is caused by their heat energy. This means that all matter is constantly releasing and absorbing heat energy. As an object absorbs heat, the molecules of that object begin to move faster, and thus, its heat energy increases. This is why heat energy is kinetic energy."}

This technique is based on the assumption that if a set of test cases is valid for one element in an equivalence class, it can be applied to all elements in that class. This approach is especially helpful when testing inputs, where it is possible to define particular classes based on the type of data that are accepted. Testing is then focused on these classes and their boundaries, thus reducing the total number of tests that are run."}

It is a basic concept of Newtonian mechanics that says that once an object is in motion, it will remain in motion until a new force is applied against it. In other words, if an object is pushed and then released, it will continue to move in the same direction unless another force is applied. The law of inertia states that an object at rest will remain at rest until a new force is applied. Latch's law is a form of Newton's laws of motion."}
